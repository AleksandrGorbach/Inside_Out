## Code Snippet

## SWOT Analysis
Strengths:
I understand most of the functionality that my app will require and how I want it to be shaped.
Weaknesses: 
Even with a solid understanding of most of the React material covered, piecing it together is still a challenge.
Opportunities:
This is a perfect chance to hone in on any shaky concepts and understand them better.
Threats:
Reaching out to others before spending a lot of time fiddling with the same bug is still a bit of a learning curve for me.
